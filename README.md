# Stacks
AWS Cloud Development Kit Stack Templates

The `bin` contains AWS CDK App definitions
The `lib` contains AWS CDK Stack definitions

There are multiple apps that can be deployed. Be sure to set the correct app in the `cdk.json` file.

## Issues
1. Unable to use an ECS Task Definition from lookup in creating an ECS Service

## Useful commands

 * `npm run test`         perform the jest unit tests
 * `cdk deploy`           deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`             compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk synth`            emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
